**Repository README**

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Jupyter Notebook files organized into distinct folders, each dedicated to various aspects of data science and machine learning. Here's a brief overview of what you can explore:

1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Dive into the world of feature engineering, where I explore techniques to enhance the quality and relevance of features in your datasets. Discover methods to extract meaningful insights and improve model performance through thoughtful feature manipulation.

2. **K-means:**
   - Uncover the power of K-means clustering through practical examples and applications. Explore the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and how K-means can be a valuable tool for grouping data points based on similarities.

3. **Naive Bayes:**
   - Delve into the realm of probabilistic classifiers with Naive Bayes. Explore the underlying principles of Bayes' theorem and witness how this algorithm can be applied to classification tasks with simplicity and effectiveness.

4. **Tree-based Models:**
   - Journey through the world of tree-based models, including decision trees and ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. Gain insights into how these models make decisions and understand their strengths in handling complex relationships within data.

Feel free to navigate through the folders, explore the notebooks, and adapt the code for your own projects. 

Happy coding and exploring! ðŸš€
